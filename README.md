# decoder-ring

Application which encodes or decodes text using the Caesar, Polybius, or Substitution ciphers.
It is intended to be used as a simple message encoder/decoder where a user enters a message, and gets either a decoded or encoded message.
While making this project, I was able to better appreciate the importance of setting a proper data structure well in advance than thinking of one on the go. I am also  thinking of expanding this project's capabilities of encoding and decoding to account for numbers.
Written with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
